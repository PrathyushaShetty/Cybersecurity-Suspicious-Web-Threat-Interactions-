## Techniques Used:
Data cleaning & preprocessing (timestamps, country codes, text normalization)
Feature engineering (request rate, request acceleration, duration, detection latency)
Exploratory Data Analysis (temporal patterns, country-level analysis, correlation heatmaps, network graph)
Machine Learning models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression
Neural Network classifier with TensorFlow/Keras
